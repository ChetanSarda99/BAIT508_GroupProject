Overview
The project is a thorough investigation into the dynamics of the US wholesale industry. This project investigates various aspects of the industry, from financial performance to textual analysis of corporate filings, using a combination of data analysis and natural language processing techniques.

Methodologies
Quantitative Analysis: Filters and analyzes corporate data using statistical methods, with a focus on industry selection and financial performance indicators.

Text Analysis: Uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to clean and process textual data from 10-K filings. Keyword extraction methods include word count and TF-IDF, as well as word embeddings with Word2Vec.
